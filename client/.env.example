# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: For Vercel deployment with cookies
# DO NOT set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL - it will bypass the proxy!
# The proxy is configured in vercel.json to route /api/* to Railway

# Backend URL for Next.js server-side rewrites (LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY)
# In production, this is handled by vercel.json rewrites
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# NOTE: When deploying to Vercel:
# 1. Update the "destination" URL in vercel.json to your Railway backend
# 2. DO NOT set any API URL environment variables in Vercel dashboard
# 3. The frontend will automatically use /api which proxies to Railway
